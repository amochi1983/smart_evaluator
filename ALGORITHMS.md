# Smart Evaluator Assistant - AI Algorithms

This document describes the artificial intelligence algorithms that will be implemented in the final version of the Smart Evaluator Assistant. In the current prototype, these algorithms are simulated with dummy data.

## 1. Document Validation Algorithm

### Objective
Automatically analyze accreditation documents to check compliance with standards and identify missing information.

### Technical Approach
- **Architecture**: NLP pipeline based on transformer models (BERT/AraBERT)
- **Components**:
  - **Structure Extractor**: CNN model to identify document sections
  - **Entity Extractor**: Named Entity Recognition (NER) for extracting key information
  - **Compliance Checker**: Fine-tuned classifier on accreditation standards
  - **Missing Information Detector**: Comparison model against complete document templates

### Training Data
- 5000+ annotated accreditation documents
- Full ISO standards (17025, 15189, 17020, etc.)
- Examples of compliant and non-compliant documents

### Performance Metrics
- Section detection accuracy: >95%
- Entity extraction accuracy: >90%
- Compliance classification accuracy: >85%
- Missing information recall: >90%

### Language Support
- Arabic (priority)
- English

## 2. Evaluator Matching Algorithm

### Objective
Automatically assign the most qualified evaluators to accreditation requests based on multiple criteria.

### Technical Approach
- **Architecture**: Hybrid recommender system
- **Components**:
  - **Content-Based Filtering**: Match between evaluator expertise and document requirements
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: Learn from past successful assignments
  - **Constraint Optimization**: Consider availability, location, workload balance
  - **Conflict of Interest Detection**: Graph analysis and NLP on affiliations

### Training Data
- History of evaluator assignments (3+ years)
- Detailed evaluator profiles (expertise, experience, performance)
- Feedback from past evaluations

### Performance Metrics
- Matching accuracy: >80%
- Evaluator satisfaction rate: >85%
- Conflict detection rate: >95%
- Workload balance: standard deviation <15%

## 3. Risk Scoring Algorithm

### Objective
Proactively identify high-risk accreditation requests requiring special attention.

### Technical Approach
- **Architecture**: Ensemble predictive models (XGBoost + Random Forest)
- **Components**:
  - **Feature Engineering**: 50+ risk indicators
  - **Ensemble Model**: Combine classifiers for robustness
  - **Temporal Analysis**: LSTM for detecting trends in historical data
  - **Anomaly Detection**: Isolation Forest to identify unusual cases

### Training Data
- Accreditation request history (success/failure)
- Issues identified in past evaluations
- Performance metrics of accredited organizations

### Performance Metrics
- Risk prediction accuracy: >80%
- High-risk recall: >90%
- AUC-ROC: >0.85
- False positive rate: <10%

## 4. Bias Mitigation System

### Objective
Ensure that system algorithms are fair and do not perpetuate existing biases.

### Technical Approach
- **Architecture**: Bias monitoring and correction pipeline
- **Components**:
  - **Bias Detection**: Fairness metrics across groups
  - **Resampling Techniques**: Balance training data
  - **Fair Learning**: Integrate fairness constraints into loss functions
  - **Explainability**: Generate explanations for algorithmic decisions

### Training Data
- Demographic data of organizations and evaluators (anonymized)
- Accreditation decision history

### Performance Metrics
- Impact disparity: <5%
- Equal opportunity: >95%
- Decision transparency: explainability score >80%

## Implementation Plan

- **Phase 1 (3 months)**: Data collection & preparation, baseline models, initial evaluation  
- **Phase 2 (2 months)**: Fine-tuning, integration tests, real-world evaluation  
- **Phase 3 (1 month)**: Gradual deployment, monitoring, user training  

## Ethical & Governance Considerations

- **Transparency**: Full documentation of algorithms and limits  
- **Human Oversight**: Critical decisions always validated by human experts  
- **Confidentiality**: Secure handling of sensitive data  
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular review to correct identified biases
